# Copy & Paste Data Structures written in C
This repo contains self-contained implementations of various data structures written in C. In order to use a data structure `ds`, simply copy and paste `ds.c` and `ds.h` into your project. Very minor changes like adding `#define bool int` may be necessary.

# Style
Operations on each data structure are prefixed with `ds_`. Since C doesn't have generics and I don't like long preprocessor macros, data is stored and passed using `void*`-pointers.

# Disclaimer
Don't expect your favorite data structure to be added here, unless you submit a PR ;-)

# License
MIT (basically: Do with it whatever you want).
